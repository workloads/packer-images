## Requirements

- HashiCorp Packer `1.10.0` or [newer](https://developer.hashicorp.com/packer/downloads)
- Ansible `2.15.0` or [newer](https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/installation_guide/intro_installation.html)
- a check-out of [@workloads/tooling](https://github.com/workloads/tooling)

Optional, and only needed for development and testing of Packs:

- `terraform-docs` `0.17.0` or [newer](https://terraform-docs.io/user-guide/installation/)
- `ansible-lint` `24.5.0` or [newer](https://ansible.readthedocs.io/projects/lint/installing/)

## Usage

This repository provides a [Makefile](./Makefile)-based workflow.

Running `make` without commands will print out the following help information:

```

### Workflow

The workflow for (most) targets is as follows:

- log in to provider's CLI interface
- create image(s)
  - initialize Packer (using `make init target=target`)
  - build Packer-managed image(s) (using `make build target=target`)

Usage differs slightly for each provider and is therefore broken out into separate sections.

See the `packer/` subdirectory for more information.

> All workflows _may_ be executed manually, though this is not advisable. See the [Makefile](./Makefile) for more information.

## Notes

### Ansible outside Packer

For rapid development and an improved feedback loop, Ansible may be run outside a Packer workflow. To do this, an [Ansible Inventory](https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/inventory_guide/intro_inventory.html) may be created like so:

```shell
make ansible_inventory host=<hostname or IP address> user=vagrant
```

This will write an Ansible Inventory file to `$(ANSIBLE_INVENTORY)` (e.g.: `$(DIR_DIST)/inventory.txt`)

Once present, Ansible may be executed using `make ansible_local`

### Development Helpers

The [Makefile](./Makefile) includes several unsupported helper targets that _may_ be useful when developing additional templates and functionality.

These targets are prefixed with an underscore (`_`) and may be removed at any time.

### Overriding Binaries

* The binaries for Ansible (`ansible`, `ansible-galaxy`, `ansible-lint`), Docker (`docker`), Packer (`packer`), Vagrant (`vagrant`) and `yaml-lint` may be overridden by setting their respective `BINARY_` equivalent arguments when running the [Makefile](./Makefile):

```shell
# override Ansible binaries
make render pack=<pack> BINARY_ANSIBLE=/tmp/ansible BINARY_ANSIBLE_GALAXY=/tmp/ansible-galaxy

# override Docker binary
make render pack=<pack> BINARY_DOCKER=custom-docker-binary
```

A complete list of overridable binaries can be found in the [Makefile](./Makefile).

### Colorized Output

Colorized CLI output may be disabled by setting the `NO_COLOR` environment variable to any non-empty value.

```shell
export NO_COLOR=1 && make
```
