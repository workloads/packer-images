## Requirements

- HashiCorp Packer `1.9.1` or [newer](https://developer.hashicorp.com/packer/downloads)
- Ansible `2.13.2` or [newer](https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/installation_guide/intro_installation.html)
- a check-out of [@workloads/tooling](https://github.com/workloads/tooling)

Optional, and only needed for development and testing of Packs:

- `terraform-docs` `0.16.0` or [newer](https://terraform-docs.io/user-guide/installation/)
- `ansible-lint` `6.17.2` or [newer](https://ansible.readthedocs.io/projects/lint/installing/)

## Usage

This repository provides a workflow that is wrapped through a [Makefile](./Makefile).

Running `make` without commands will print out the following help information:

Target          Description                                     Usage
init            initialize a Packer Image                       `make init target=my_target os=my_os`
lint            lint a Packer Image                             `make lint target=my_target os=my_os`
build           build a Packer Image                            `make build target=my_target os=my_os`
docs            generate documentation for all Packer Images    `make docs target=my_target os=my_os`
test            test a Packer Image                             `make test target=my_target os=my_os`
help            display a list of Make Targets                  `make help`
_listincludes   list all included Makefiles and *.mk files      `make _listincludes`
_selfcheck      lint Makefile                                   `make _selfcheck`
```


```text
clean  Remove "distributables" directory
roles  Install Ansible Collections and Roles

```

### Helpers

The [Makefile](./Makefile) includes several unsupported helper targets that _may_ be useful when developing in this repository.

| target          | description                                        |
|-----------------|----------------------------------------------------|
| `_dist`         | Opens the "distributables" directory (macOS only)  |
| `_lint_ansible` | Lints Ansible Playbooks using `ansible-lint`       |
| `_lint_yaml`    | Lints YAML files using `yamllint`                  |
| `_lint`         | Executes `_lint_yaml`, followed by `_lint_ansible` |
| `_vb`           | Opens "VirtualBox.app" (macOS only)                |

Unsupported targets are prefixed by an underscore (`_`).

### Workflow

The workflow for (most) targets is as follows:

- log in to provider's CLI interface
- create image(s)
  - initialize Packer (using `make init target=target`)
  - build Packer-managed image(s) (using `make build target=target`)

Usage differs slightly for each provider and is therefore broken out into separate sections.

See the `packer/` subdirectory for more information.

> All workflows _can_ be executed manually, though this is not advisable. See the [Makefile](./Makefile) for more information.

### Build Options

The following generic build options are available:

#### `debug`

Enables debug mode and disables parallelization.
See [here](https://developer.hashicorp.com/packer/docs/debugging) for more information.

#### `dev`

Enables _developer-mode_ and configures developer-friendly tooling.

#### `force`

Forces a builder to run when artifacts from a previous build prevent a build from running.
See [here](https://developer.hashicorp.com/packer/docs/commands/build#force) for more information.

#### `machine-readable`

Enable a fully machine-readable output setting, allowing you to use Packer in automated environments.
See [here](https://developer.hashicorp.com/packer/docs/commands#machine-readable-output) for more information.

#### `timestamp`

Prefix all build steps with an RFC3339-formatted timestamp.
See [here](https://developer.hashicorp.com/packer/docs/commands/build#timestamp-ui) for more information.

Additional Build Options may be available, depending on the target.

### Supported Providers

This repository supports the following providers:

| target         | local documentation                                    | Packer Builder                                                                         |
