## Requirements

- HashiCorp Packer `1.9.1` or [newer](https://developer.hashicorp.com/packer/downloads)
- Ansible `2.15.1` or [newer](https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/installation_guide/intro_installation.html)
- a check-out of [@workloads/tooling](https://github.com/workloads/tooling)

Optional, and only needed for development and testing of Packs:

- `terraform-docs` `0.16.0` or [newer](https://terraform-docs.io/user-guide/installation/)
- `ansible-lint` `6.17.2` or [newer](https://ansible.readthedocs.io/projects/lint/installing/)

## Usage

This repository provides a workflow that is wrapped through a [Makefile](./Makefile).

Running `make` without commands will print out the following help information:

_link_vars          create a symlink to the shared variables file for a new target    `make _link_vars target  my_target`
help                display a list of Make Targets                                    `make help`
_listincludes       list all included Makefiles and *.mk files                        `make _listincludes`
_selfcheck          lint Makefile                                                     `make _selfcheck`
```

### Workflow

The workflow for (most) targets is as follows:

- log in to provider's CLI interface
- create image(s)
  - initialize Packer (using `make init target=target`)
  - build Packer-managed image(s) (using `make build target=target`)

Usage differs slightly for each provider and is therefore broken out into separate sections.

See the `packer/` subdirectory for more information.

> All workflows _may_ be executed manually, though this is not advisable. See the [Makefile](./Makefile) for more information.

## Notes

### Ansible outside Packer

For rapid development and an improved feedback loop, Ansible may be run outside a Packer workflow. To do this, an [Ansible Inventory](https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/inventory_guide/intro_inventory.html) may be created like so:

```shell
make ansible_inventory host=<hostname or IP address> user=vagrant
```

This will write an Ansible Inventory file to `$(ANSIBLE_INVENTORY)` (e.g.: `$(DIR_DIST)/inventory.txt`)

Once present, Ansible may be executed using `make ansible_local`


### Development Helpers

The [Makefile](./Makefile) includes several unsupported helper targets that _may_ be useful when developing additional templates and functionality.

These targets are prefixed with an underscore (`_`) and may be removed at any time.
