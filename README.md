## Requirements

- Packer `1.7.8` or newer
- Terraform `1.1.3` or newer
- Ansible `2.12.1` or newer
- direnv `2.30.3` or newer

Ansible is used for system-level operations (e.g.: installing and removing packages).

Terraform is used as a helper, only. It is possible (though not advised) to manually create the resources needed.

Direnv is used as a helper to programmatically load environment variables.

## Usage

This repository contains Packer templates for multiple providers.

The primary way of interacting with this repository is `make` via the included [Makefile](Makefile).

This allows for a consistent execution of the underlying workflows.

The currently supported options are:

```text
PACKER TEMPLATES

help               Displays this help text
env-info           Prints Version Information
build              Builds an Image with Packer
init               Installs and upgrades Packer Plugins
lint               Formats and validates Packer Template
terraform-plan     Plans prerequisite resources with Terraform
terraform-apply    Creates prerequisite resources with Terraform
terraform-destroy  Destroys prerequisite resources with Terraform
terraform-init     Initializes Terraform
```

### Helpers

The [Makefile](Makefile) includes several unsupported helper targets that _may_ be useful when developing in this repository.

| target                  | description                                            |
|-------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------|
| `_clean`                | (Forcefully) Removes the `generated` directory         |
| `_gen`                  | Opens the `generated` directory (macOS only)           |
| `_install_ansible_reqs` | Fetch and Install Ansible Galaxy Collections and Roles |
| `_lint_ansible`         | Lints Ansible Playbooks using `ansible-lint`           |
| `_lint_yaml`            | Lints YAML files using `yamllint`                      |
| `_lint`                 | Executes `_lint_yaml`, followed by `_lint_ansible`     |
| `_ssh`                  | Executes `vagrant ssh`                                 |
| `_up`                   | Executes `vagrant up`                                  |
| `_vb`                   | Opens "VirtualBox.app" (macOS only)                    |

Unsupported targets are prefixed by an underscore (`_`).

### Workflow

The workflow for (most) targets is as follows:

- log in to provider's CLI interface
- create prerequisite resources
  - initialize Terraform (using `make terraform-init target=target`)
  - create Terraform-managed resources (using `make terraform-apply target=target`)
- create image(s)
  - initialize Packer (using `make init target=target`)
  - build Packer-managed image(s) (using `make build target=target`)
- optionally: delete prerequisite resources
  - delete Terraform-managed resources (using `make terraform-destroy target=target`)

Usage differs slightly for each provider and is therefore broken out into separate sections.

See the `packer/` (and `terraform/`) sub-directories for more information.

> All workflows _can_ be executed manually, though this is not advisable. See the [Makefile](Makefile) for more information.

### Build Options

The following generic build options are available:

#### `debug`

Disables parallelization and enables debug mode.
See [here](https://www.packer.io/docs/commands/build#debug) for more information.

#### `enable-inspec`

Enable the InSpec Provisioner and image validation against included baselines.
See [here](https://www.packer.io/docs/provisioners/inspec) for more information.

#### `except`

Run all builds, provisioners and post-processors except those with the given comma-separated names.
See [here](https://www.packer.io/docs/commands/build#except-foo-bar-baz) for more information.

#### `force`

Forces a builder to run when artifacts from a previous build prevent a build from running.
See [here](https://www.packer.io/docs/commands/build#force) for more information.

#### `machine-readable`

Enable a fully machine-readable output setting, allowing you to use Packer in automated environments.
See [here](https://www.packer.io/docs/commands#machine-readable-output) for more information.

#### `only`

Only run the builds with the given comma-separated names.
See [here](https://www.packer.io/docs/commands/build#only-foo-bar-baz) for more information.

#### `on-error`

Selects what to do when the build fails during provisioning.
See [here](https://www.packer.io/docs/commands/build#on-error-cleanup) for more information.

#### `parallel-builds`

Limit the number of builds to run in parallel.
See [here](https://www.packer.io/docs/commands/build#parallel-builds-n) for more information.

#### `timestamp-ui`

Enable prefixing of each ui output with an RFC3339 timestamp.
See [here](https://www.packer.io/docs/commands/build#timestamp-ui) for more information.

#### `var-file`

Set template variables from a file.
See [here](https://www.packer.io/docs/commands/build#var-file) for more information.

Additional Build Options may be available, depending on the target.
